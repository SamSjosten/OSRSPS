# OSRSPS

A private Old School RuneScape test server for developing RuneLite plugins against 1:1 recreations of live content.
Our own engine in Kotlin on Java 21, using [RSProt](https://github.com/blurite/rsprot) for the network protocol.

Target revision: **241** (see `src/main/kotlin/osrsps/Revision.kt`).

## Never commit Jagex files

The game cache, the client, XTEA keys, RSA keys and gameplay recordings stay out of this repo.
They live under `data/` (git-ignored) on the machine that runs the server.

## Build and run

Needs JDK 21. The Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle itself.

Sandbox VM (bash):

```bash
./gradlew build run
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build run
```

A successful run logs `OSRSPS server skeleton, revision 241`.

## Get the cache

The server downloads the live revision 241 cache and its XTEA keys from the [OpenRS2 archive](https://archive.openrs2.org)
into `data/cache/` (set `OSRSPS_DATA` to use another folder). Run this on the sandbox VM:

```bash
./gradlew run --args=fetch-cache   # download, then print a summary
./gradlew run --args=cache-info    # summarise an existing download
```

`data/cache-source.txt` records which OpenRS2 cache was used.
