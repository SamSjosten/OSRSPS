# OSRSPS

A private Old School RuneScape test server for developing RuneLite plugins against 1:1 recreations of live content.
Our own engine in Kotlin on Java 21, using [RSProt](https://github.com/blurite/rsprot) for the network protocol.

Target revision: **241** (see `src/main/kotlin/osrsps/Revision.kt`).

## Never commit Jagex files

The game cache, the client, XTEA keys, RSA keys and gameplay recordings stay out of this repo.
They live under `data/` (git-ignored) on the machine that runs the server.

## Build and run

Needs JDK 21. The Gradle wrapper downloads Gradle itself.

Sandbox VM (bash):

```bash
./gradlew build run
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat build run
```

A successful run logs `OSRSPS server skeleton, revision 241`.

## Get the cache

The server downloads the live revision 241 cache and its XTEA keys from the [OpenRS2 archive](https://archive.openrs2.org)
into `data/cache/` (set `OSRSPS_DATA` to use another folder). Run this on the sandbox VM:

```bash
./gradlew run --args=fetch-cache   # download, then print a summary
./gradlew run --args=cache-info    # summarise an existing download
```

`data/cache-source.txt` records which OpenRS2 cache was used.

## Run the server

```bash
./gradlew run --args=serve          # JS5 and game on port 43594
./gradlew run --args="serve 50000"  # another port (launcher files on 50001)
```

RSProx assumes the game port is 43594. For another port, add `game_server_port: 50000` to the RSProx target below.

The first start generates a 1024-bit RSA key in `data/rsa.key` and writes its modulus to `data/rsa-modulus.txt`.
Any username and password log in, and you appear in Lumbridge.

## Keep it running with Docker

On the VM, Docker keeps the server up across crashes and reboots. `data/` is mounted into the container, so the
cache and RSA key are shared with the Gradle commands above.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build   # build and start; rerun after pulling changes
docker compose logs -f         # follow the log
docker compose down            # stop
```

## Connect RuneLite through RSProx

The server also hosts the launcher files on the HTTP port (game port + 1): `jav_config.ws` and `world_list.ws`,
both pointing at `OSRSPS_PUBLIC_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`). RSProx reads them to find the world and connects to that
host on the game port.

**Over the LAN** (once the Proxmox host forwards 43594 and 43595 to the VM; the compose file sets
`OSRSPS_PUBLIC_HOST=192.168.0.210`): nothing needs to run on your PC.

**Over an SSH tunnel** (PowerShell, keep the window open; the default public host 127.0.0.1 matches this):

```powershell
ssh -J root@192.168.0.210 -L 43594:127.0.0.1:43594 -L 43595:127.0.0.1:43595 sam@10.99.0.10
```

Then add a target to `%USERPROFILE%\.rsprox\proxy-targets.yaml`, with the modulus from `data/rsa-modulus.txt`
on the VM and the host you use above:

```yaml
config:
  - name: OSRSPS
    jav_config_url: http://192.168.0.210:43595/jav_config.ws
    revision: 241.1
    modulus: <contents of data/rsa-modulus.txt>
    # game_server_port: 50000   # only when the server runs on a port other than 43594
```

Launch RuneLite from RSProx with that target and log in with any username and password.

## Walking

Click the game view or minimap to walk. The run orb toggles running, ctrl-click inverts walk/run for one click, and
ctrl+shift-click teleports to the clicked tile (a testing tool). Collision is built from the cache's map files at
startup; the log line `Loaded collision for N map squares` confirms it.

To see what the server thinks is walkable around a tile (north up, `###` blocked, `[ ] ^ _` walls):

```bash
docker compose run --rm osrsps collision 3222 3218   # x z [level]; default is the Lumbridge spawn
```

Movement rules and where they come from:

| Rule | Source |
|------|--------|
| Route search: the client's 128x128 breadth-first search, neighbour order W, E, S, N, SW, SE, NW, NE | client behaviour |
| Unreachable target: closest reached tile within 10, by distance then path length | client behaviour |
| Walk 1 tile a tick, run 2; an odd last tile is walked | OSRS Wiki |
| Run drain ⌊60 + 67 × weight / 64⌋ × (1 − agility / 300), restore ⌊agility / 10⌋ + 15 a tick | OSRS Wiki, Energy |
| Run switches off at 0 energy; one-tile ticks don't drain | guessed |
| Map rebuild within 16 tiles of the 104x104 build area's edge | inferred, not measured |
| Routes cut to 25 turns | guessed |

## Developer commands

Type these in the chatbox; the answer shows as a game message. Every player can use them.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `::pos` | Your coordinates as `x, z, level`, plus the map region and your tile inside it |
| `::tele x z [level]` | Teleports there; the level stays the same when left out. `::tele 3222, 3218, 0` also works, so `::pos` output pastes in |
| `::tick` | The server's current tick number |
| `::varp id [value]` | Shows a varp, or sets it. `::varp 173 1` turns the run orb on |
| `::varbit id [value]` | Shows a varbit with the varp and bits it lives in, or sets it |

Commands live in `src/main/kotlin/osrsps/game/command/`; register new ones on `World.commands`.

Varps and varbits are per player (`Player.vars`). Varbit layouts come from cache config 14 and the number of varps
from config 16; a changed varp is sent once at the end of the tick, with its value then. The run orb is varp 173.

## Chat

Anything typed without `::` is public chat: it shows over your head and in the chatbox of every player who can see you, yourself included. Colour and effect prefixes (`red:`, `wave:`, `pattern...`) work. Code is in `src/main/kotlin/osrsps/game/PublicChat.kt`.

| Rule | Source |
|------|--------|
| 80 characters at most; types 0 (normal) and 1 (autotyper) are public chat | RSProt / client behaviour |
| A colour, effect or pattern the client can't send falls back to plain yellow | guessed |
| Friends, clan and guest channel messages get "There are no chat-channels on this server yet." | ours, no channels yet |
| Public, private and trade filter changes are echoed back so the tab labels update; nothing is filtered on the server | inferred |
| "Welcome to Old School RuneScape." after login | from memory of live, not a recording |
